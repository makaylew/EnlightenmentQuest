Enlightenment Quest

OVERVIEW
GAMEPLAY
The gameplay experience will be first-person perspective through immersive environments featuring minimal user interaction, the threat of approaching enemies, and the ability to change the environment by refocusing the character through a practice symbolizing meditation. 

The storyline of Enlightenment Quest parallels a metaphorical journey toward enlightenment as presented through the practice of Zen Buddhism in which Nirvana, or ultimate enlightenment, is, at least for most practitioners, an unattainable goal in this lifetime to which one’s life must nevertheless dedicated towards achieving in order to reach a state of personal fulfillment akin to self-actualization. In this sense, the player in Enlightenment Quest is on a journey that does feature a sense of progression toward immediate goals in which the environment can change through the correct action, but not any tangible over-arching goal which would signify an end to the game nor any scoring, level, or achievement-tracking system. 

The player will be automatically in motion toward a designated direction in each environment. The only action available to the player will be to meditate which, if done for a long enough period of time, will cause the Zen Master to appear who will direct the player to begin a new journey in a new direction so the environment will change. Each environment will feature threatening characters that will keep populating unless the player meditates and then they will disappear, but this action does not necessarily need to occur long enough for the Zen master to appear. If the player only ever meditates long enough for the characters to disappear and not enough for the Zen master to appear, the environment will never change and the gameplay will repeat itself. 
Target Platform / Minimum Hardware:
The goal of this project is to make this game on as many platforms as possible so it can be accessible to a greater public. With this being said, due to the simplistic form of the UI and gameplay, this game will have very minimal hardware requirements and may therefore be particularly well-suited for mobile devices. Since only one action is available (meditation), this action can be tapping the screen on mobile devices.
Visual Style
Each environment will be based on nature, but the emphasis in creating each area will be ease of user experience rather than creating realistic environments which parallel the natural world.

The aesthetic style of the game will be cartoonish, yet still 3-dimensional, so as to de-emphasize any realistic quality and emphasize the metaphorical and imaginative quality. To encourage accessibility and familiarity, certain visual elements, such as the form of the Zen master, or physical features in each environment will be almost stereotypical in design (e.g. the Zen master will be a monk with a long beard, robes, and shaved head while shark’s fins and waves will be particularly pointy and cartoonish in design).

Audio Style
While perhaps not attainable in early versions of this game, the eventual goal for audio is for each environment to feature a distinctive, atmospheric soundtrack that corresponds and evolves according to the movement of the player as well as the player’s interaction with the environment and other characters.  The purpose of the music would be to compliment and enhance both the environment and the metaphorical quality of the journey on which the player is traveling. 
The only dialogue to be included would be the words of the Zen Master, but this will only be implemented if it can be without dominating and taking away from the soundtrack. 
The presence of the threatening characters would not be accompanied by sound effects or dialogue, but the music would change to become more ominous as they are approaching.  

Starting Out 
Game start – Main Menu – Character Selection/Creation

The main menu will be, like the rest of the gameplay, simple and minimalist. As the game loads, a loading screen will appear with the title screen and the loading bar at which time the only option available will be to mute the audio, if desired. 

After the loading screen, the only new options available on the menu will be to continue or start a new journey. The option to mute audio will also still be available. 

If the player chooses new game, a new screen will appear with choices of starting environments. Since the game is non-linear, the starting environment will only affect the order in which new environments spawn rather than the level at which the player starts.

No character selection will be available at this time, but options to select different qualities of the audio soundtrack (e.g. genre or aesthetic quality) may be available, if possible to implement.
Game Start and Intro 
After the player proceeds past the menu, the player will be automatically in motion in the chosen environment. 

If the player chose the “continue” option at the menu screen, the environment displayed will be the one at which the player last left off. No other information, such as what environments, were already displayed, will have been saved. 

The player can begin meditating at any time by implementing the designated action or command, but the environment will not change and the Zen master will not appear until a designated time period has elapsed before the action is implemented. 


UI
Main Menu
The design of the menu will be minimalist and only feature the options for “new game” and “continue game” in simple text button-style with unembellished ellipses or similarly minimal borders over clouds or similarly ambiguous moving and repetitive backgrounds. 
Game Over Screen
While the game will not include a typical “Game Over” screen and the player cannot lose since the gameplay is not goal-driven or objective oriented, the environment will completely disappear if the player does not meditate by implementing the designated action and too many characters enter the environment and get too close to the player. If this happens, the screen will become completely black and the music will stop or slow-down  and quiet considerably to become barely audible until the player implements the action and meditates. If the screen is black due to too many threats and not meditating, the player will need to meditate for a longer time than would be otherwise be the case while the environment repopulates before the Zen master appears and the environment can eventually change. 
Environment Selection 
Each environment will be repetitive without a clear start or finish and the player will automatically start in motion once the environment populates. Whether the player chooses an environment from the menu screen or the environment appears after the Zen master appeared in another environment will not affect gameplay. Once an environment is chosen and the player gets the Zen master to appear, the next environment to appear will be randomly chosen (with the exception of the current environment not being an option for random selection). The Zen Master’s dialogue will be automatically generated to correspond with the next environment. After the Zen Master appears and the player implements the action command, a short animation will appear to transition from the current environment to the next environment. 

The word environment is being used more often than level herein because the word level indicates goal-directed and objective-oriented or achievement-based gameplay. The difficulty, extent of detail, or culmination of attributes will not be substantially different between environments and no one environment will necessarily follow or be more advance than another. 

Full Environment List
At this time, the game will be comprised of three environments (A, B, and C), all of which will have a fixed path on which the player will be in motion and cannot deviate from. The order in which the environments appear below is random since they will appear in random order within the game. 
Desert - The environment will be comprised of rolling sand dunes, a distant horizon with the sky a consistent color and minimal, if present, clouds. The player will be in motion toward the horizon. The threatening character in this environment will be snakes.  
Mountain - The environment will be an upward-facing rock face with the peak never in sight, but clouds may appear toward what could be the peak. The player will always be in motion (walking more than climbing) upwards toward the clouds or what would be the peak if it were visible. The threatening character in this environment will be wolves. 
Ocean - The environment will be comprised of a vast body of water with rolling or jagged waves and a distant horizon of an idyllic sunset or clear sky. The player will be in motion toward the horizon and the placement of the player will be low, will the waves coming up alongside the player’s field of vision as much as possible to simulate the process of swimming. The threatening character in this environment will be sharks. 
Gameplay
Due to the non-linear, non-goal-driven approach, the gameplay experience is intended to be relaxing more than stressful or anxiety-causing. With this being said, each environment features characters which threaten to consume the gameplay experience if the player does not meditate which will remove any other such characters from the environment and, if done for enough time, will cause a Zen master character to be revealed who will guide the player to a new environment. If the player does not meditate or only meditates long enough for the threatening characters to disappear, the environment will never change and the player will only be able to travel infinitely in one direction. The environments will thus feature a clear path from which the player cannot deviate and the player is, at all times, automatically in motion. The only controls available at all times will be to meditate.

No instructions will be available for the game other than a brief indicator at the start of gameplay indicating the action or command for meditate (one word such as “tap” or “space” rather than explaining what it does) that will briefly reappear if the gameplay goes on too long in one environment and the action is not being triggered.

To summarize, the challenges facing the player are twofold: 
If the player does not meditate (implements the action) at all, the gameplay will stop once too many hostile characters are deployed. 
If the player does not meditate (implements the action) enough, the gameplay will become repetitive and never change. 

The player will have an adversarial relationship with the threatening characters in each environment, but the player does have any means of fighting or physically engaging these adversaries other than making them disappear through meditation. The game is non-competitive and the only objectives are keeping the adversaries to a minimum and bringing about the appearance of new environments through meditation. 

If other elements will be present in the environments, such as trees or rocks, the player will not be able to interact with these elements and they will be off to the side of the path on which the player is in motion. 

Projected Gameplay Developments for the Future
Over time, through the course of development, more environments will become available so that the game will still remain interesting for frequent use. Distant development goals include dynamically-generated content, environments, and music to allow for the most random and interesting gameplay experience. More possible interactions with environments, objects, and characters than already discussed are not planned at this time.  

Mechanics
All movement is continuous and automatic with the only changes in environment brought on by the action or inaction of the user in so far as the user either meditates enough to change the environment or does not meditate to keep the hostile characters from populating too much and the gameplay ceases. 
Controls
The player’s only action is to meditate. This one action will be the most obvious command depending on the platform so either tapping the screen of a mobile device or pressing the space bar on a computer and the one action will be indicated through a pop-up message at the start of gameplay and intermittently when gameplay goes on too long without the action being implemented.

Characters
The only humanoid character to be included is the Zen Master whose influences will be stereotypical and iconic, almost comic or satirical in style to allow for the most accessibility and easiest recognizability.  The Zen master will have a long beard, flowing robes, and a bald head. His words will be carefully chosen and his demeanor will be calm. 
The more threatening characters will also employ stereotypes, but their demeanor will be menacing, if possible, even if the overall style is still comic-influenced. The sharks and wolves will emphasize teeth in their expression while the snake will emphasize tongue and rattle in its expression, with the movement and expressions of each character being repetitive and monotonous as they approach. 
Environmental

Each environment will feature a clear point of horizon at the point of intersection of a forward-facing plane and a perpendicularly-intersecting plane for the sky. The ocean and desert environments will be the same in the regard of the angle of these two intersecting planes, but, for the mountain environment, the forward-facing plane will be nearly, but not quite, parallel with the perpendicularly-intersecting plane for the sky. Each environment will also feature rock formations and the rolling of land or water that may be the same at least for the desert and ocean environments although the waves will most likely to be need to a special asset.  Other assets, such as any vegetation or rock formation can be shared. 
Audio
Each threatening character may have a sound as it approaches or at least once enough of its kind dominate the screen and cause the gameplay to cease. These animal sounds will be specific to the threatening character, but may sound like a bite or hiss. The only other UI sounds other than ambient noise or the soundtrack will be a sound that potentially occurs when meditating at least once achieving a higher level such as making threatening creatures disappearing or bringing about the Zen Master. The meditation sound may be either a chime or a deep exhale.  The ambient noise may include ambient environmental noises, but will most likely be a consistent yet dynamically-influenced soundtrack distinct for each environment. 
Back Story 
The back story of this game would be comprised of many Zen parables and allegories for enlightenment which emphasize the path to enlightenment as continuous without an end in sight, but nevertheless important. This game is also a metaphor for the importance of meditation and taking time out from the stressors of life in order to advance. 
As the character’s journey continues, and the Zen master appears enough times, more of the story will begin to develop, but the general premise would be indicated through Zen parables with the idea of the path to enlightenment being continuous, long, and nirvana being the impossible to achieve yet important goal that should be overarching in all instances. 
Cinematics
Every environment will have a transitional cinematic from the previous scene in which the player was immersed to make the transition appear more seamless. Due to the random nature in which environments are revealed, this will require each environment to have a cinematic featuring a transition from each of the other existing possible environments. For instance, the Mountain environment will have a transitional cinematic from both the Ocean and Desert environments. This is the main reason why development is currently limited to only three environments and why the inclusion more environments would be distant development goals.
