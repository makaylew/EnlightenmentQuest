What is Enlightenment Quest?

Enlightenment Quest is a game concept still (as of March 2022) in initial stages of development. 

Objective: Enlightment Quest is an immersive RPG-style environment with a storyline paralleling the journey towards enlightenment or spiritual awakening that spiritual or Mindfulness practitioners may partake. 

Gameplay: The player navigates through a 3d environment, ignoring distractions from NPC's appearing hostile, to find peaceful moments. 

Audio: Immersive binaural ambient soundscapes will play continuously and will be responsive to gameplay, changing in nature. 

Current state: The game is still in conceptual stages and the current repository (as of March 2022) are game fragments for a Unity 3d environment. 

Developmental Goals: Will be recreated as a simple, retro-style raycasting 2D RPG using Pygame.

Future Plans: The hope is that this game will eventually be possible to recreate in VR as a meditative experience.
